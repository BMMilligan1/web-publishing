## Overview

The Ocean Health Tracker provides real-time monitoring of critical ocean health indicators across Pacific island nations. This dashboard integrates multiple data sources to present a comprehensive view of ocean conditions, supporting evidence-based decision making for marine conservation and sustainable resource management.

## How to Use This Dashboard

1. **Filter by Region**: Use the region selector to focus on specific Pacific areas
2. **Adjust Time Range**: View historical trends or focus on recent changes
3. **Export Data**: Click the export button to download underlying datasets
4. **Share Insights**: Use the share function to distribute specific views

## Key Insights

### Temperature Trends
Ocean temperatures in the Pacific have risen by an average of 0.8°C over the past decade, with some regions experiencing even higher anomalies. This warming trend has significant implications for:
- Coral bleaching events
- Fish migration patterns
- Storm intensity

### Coral Reef Status
Current coral coverage stands at 47% of historical baseline, with a 5.2% decline over the past year. However, some protected areas show signs of recovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of conservation measures.

### Fisheries Health
Fish stock assessments indicate overall health score of 73/100, with improvements in managed fisheries but continued pressure in unregulated areas.

## Data Notes

- Temperature data updated daily from satellite observations
- Coral health assessments conducted quarterly
- Fish stock data based on scientific surveys and catch reports
- All data undergo quality control before dashboard integration
