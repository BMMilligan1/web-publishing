# Ocean Health Dashboard Launch

**January 15, 2024** â€” We're excited to announce the launch of our new Ocean Health Dashboard, providing real-time monitoring and visualization of critical marine ecosystem indicators across the Pacific region.

## Features

The dashboard offers:

- **Real-time data updates** from over 200 monitoring stations
- **Interactive visualizations** of ocean temperature, pH levels, and biodiversity metrics
- **Customizable alerts** for anomalous conditions
- **Historical trend analysis** spanning 20 years of data

## Why It Matters

"This dashboard democratizes access to ocean data," said Dr. Maria Santos, Director of Ocean Research. "Policymakers, researchers, and communities can now track ocean health indicators in real-time, enabling more responsive conservation efforts."

## Key Indicators Tracked

The dashboard monitors:

1. **Sea Surface Temperature**: Daily updates from satellite and buoy data
2. **Ocean Acidification**: pH measurements from monitoring stations
3. **Coral Bleaching Risk**: Predictive models based on temperature stress
4. **Marine Protected Area Coverage**: Progress tracking against conservation targets
5. **Fish Stock Health**: Biomass estimates for key commercial species

## Data Partners

The dashboard integrates data from:
- NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory
- IOC-UNESCO Ocean Biodiversity Information System
- Regional ocean observing systems
- Community-based monitoring networks

## Access the Dashboard

Visit our [Ocean Health Tracker](/dashboards/ocean-health-tracker) to explore the data and create custom visualizations.

## Future Enhancements

Planned updates include:
- Machine learning predictions for ecosystem health
- Mobile app for field researchers
- API access for developers
- Additional language support
