# New Report: Climate Finance Flows 2023

**January 20, 2024** â€” The Centre for Sustainable Development Reform today released its comprehensive analysis of global climate finance flows for 2023, revealing persistent gaps in adaptation funding, particularly for Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

## Key Findings

The report, which analyzed over $83 billion in climate finance commitments, found that:

- **Only 38% of climate finance** went to adaptation measures, despite repeated calls for balance between adaptation and mitigation funding
- **SIDS received just 2% of total climate finance**, despite being among the most vulnerable to climate impacts
- **Private sector mobilization** fell short of targets, reaching only $12.4 billion compared to the $25 billion goal

## Critical Gaps Identified

Dr. Sarah Chen, lead author of the report, stated: "While overall climate finance has increased, the distribution remains heavily skewed toward mitigation projects in larger economies. The countries most vulnerable to climate change continue to receive inadequate support."

The analysis identified several critical gaps:

1. **Access barriers**: Complex application procedures preventing SIDS from accessing funds
2. **Grant vs. loan imbalance**: Over 70% of climate finance provided as loans rather than grants
3. **Adaptation underfunding**: Persistent gap in adaptation finance, particularly for ecosystem-based solutions

## Recommendations

The report calls for:
- Simplified access procedures for vulnerable countries
- Increased grant-based financing for adaptation
- Enhanced tracking and transparency mechanisms
- Greater focus on locally-led climate action
