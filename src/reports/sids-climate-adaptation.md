4. **Economic Vulnerability**: Limited financial capacity for adaptation measures

## Policy Recommendations

### 1. Infrastructure Resilience
- Climate-proof critical infrastructure
- Nature-based coastal protection solutions
- Elevated construction standards

### 2. Financial Mechanisms
- Enhanced access to climate finance
- Innovative insurance instruments
- Regional risk pooling initiatives

### 3. Capacity Building
- Technical training programs
- Knowledge sharing platforms
- South-South cooperation

### 4. Governance
- Integrated coastal zone management
- Cross-sectoral coordination
- Community-based adaptation planning

## Case Studies

- **Fiji**: Planned village relocations
- **Maldives**: Floating island development
- **Barbados**: Blue economy initiatives
