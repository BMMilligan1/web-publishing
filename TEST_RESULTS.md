# Test Results - Unified Static Architecture

## Date: 2024-01-30

### Test Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| npm install | ✅ Success | All dependencies installed |
| Illustration generation | ✅ Success | 8 SVG files generated |
| Observable build | ✅ Success | Built 8 pages including our new content |
| News page generation | ✅ Success | Generated news index and homepage |
| Observable content processing | ❌ Failed | JSDOM navigator property issue |
| PDF generation | ⚠️ Partial | Script runs but had connection issues |
| DOI minting | ✅ Success* | Zenodo API connection verified, token is valid |

### Key Findings

1. **Observable Framework Integration**
   - Successfully recognizes and builds our new content files
   - Uses its own HTML template system (not our custom templates)
   - Generated HTML files in dist/ directory

2. **Illustration Generation**
   - All 8 SVG illustrations created successfully
   - Files properly saved in `src/_theme/assets/illustrations/`

3. **Zenodo API**
   - Your token is valid and working
   - Successfully connected to Zenodo API
   - Account shows 1 existing deposition

4. **Issues Identified**
   - Observable content processing has JSDOM compatibility issues
   - PDF generation needs running localhost or file serving
   - Minor import issue in DOI script (fixed)

### Next Steps

1. The core architecture is in place and mostly functional
2. Observable Framework's template system will need adaptation
3. The build pipeline works but needs some debugging for production use
4. Your Zenodo token is confirmed working for DOI minting

### File Structure Verified

The implementation successfully created:
- 37+ new files
- Complete directory structure
- All CSS with teal color scheme
- All build scripts
- Example content demonstrating features

The unified static architecture is ready for further development and debugging!
